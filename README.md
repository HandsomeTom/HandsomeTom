Iâ€™m proficient in several programming languages â€” C, C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and I can wrangle some HTML/CSS when the situation gets desperate. Sure, I know them well, but letâ€™s be real: half the battle is knowing how to scrape through old Stack Overflow posts.
When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in code or optimizing servers, Iâ€™m probably thinking about how to break (and fix) things in creative ways. Also, Unix systems, networking (both hardware and software), and virtualization (Proxmox) are part of my toolkit.

However, I do have a simple puzzle platformer published on steam by the very company I work for at the moment, Panic Art Studios;
